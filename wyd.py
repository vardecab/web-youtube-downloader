# when a user visits the root URL of the app, Flask will call the home function

# ------------ run the app ----------- #


if __name__ == '__main__':  # common programming idiom that allows you to specify code that should only be executed if the Python script is run directly as the main program, rather than being imported as a module into another program
    # run app in debug mode: auto-reload, error messages etc.
    app.run(debug=True)
    # app.run() # run app

# NOTE: to run the app: `python wyd.py` in Terminal`
# NOTE: test URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
